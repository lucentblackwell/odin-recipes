    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kimchi is a traditional Korean side dish made from salted and fermented vegetables, most commonly napa cabbage, seasoned with a vibrant mixture of chili powder, garlic, ginger, and fish sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Napa Cabbage: 1 large head (cut into quarters)</li>
      <li>Coarse Salt: 1 cup (for brining)</li>
      <li>Water: Enough to cover the cabbage</li>
      <li>Kimchi Paste: 
        <ul>
          <li>Korean Chili Flakes (Gochugaru): 1/2 cup</li>
          <li>Fish Sauce: 1/4 cup</li>
          <li>Chopped garlic: 1 tablespoon</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Rub the coarse salt liberally onto every leaf of the cabbage quarters.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Place the salted cabbage in a large bowl, cover with water, and let it sit for 2-3 hours. The cabbage should wilt and become pliable.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Thoroughly rinse the cabbage under cold water 2-3 times to remove excess salt. Squeeze out the water and let it drain for about 30 minutes</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>In a separate bowl, mix the Korean Chili Flakes (Gochugaru), Fish Sauce, and chopped Garlic to form the kimchi paste.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Wear gloves! Rub the kimchi paste onto every leaf of the prepared cabbage quarters. Ensure the paste is evenly distributed.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Tightly pack the kimchi into an airtight glass jar. Leave a little space at the top.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Leave the jar at room temperature for 1-2 days to kickstart fermentation (the kimchi will begin to smell sour and produce bubbles).</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Transfer the jar to the refrigerator. Kimchi is ready to eat immediately but will continue to ferment and develop deeper, sour flavors over weeks.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
